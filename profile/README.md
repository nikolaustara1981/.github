Passionate software developer with over a decade of experience in building scalable web applications. Proficient in languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Java, with a strong focus on backend development using Node.js and Django. Advocate of clean code principles, test-driven development, and agile methodologies for delivering high-quality software.

Currently exploring the vast possibilities of cloud computing with AWS and deploying containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes. Have a keen interest in data science and machine learning, often implementing algorithms in Python to solve real-world problems. Excited by modern frameworks like React and Vue.js, frequently developing dynamic user interfaces that create seamless user experiences.

Always enthusiastic about contributing to open-source projects. One of my proudest moments was contributing to a popular JavaScript library that now helps thousands of developers streamline their workflow. Constantly learning and staying up-to-date with emerging technologies and trends in the software development world.

In my spare time, I enjoy participating in hackathons and coding competitions. I have a knack for problem-solving and love tackling challenges head-on. Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking and exploring the outdoors, always looking for new adventures.
